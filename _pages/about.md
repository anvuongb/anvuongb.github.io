## About me

Hi there, welcome to my personal website. 

I'm currently a 4th-year PhD student at Oregon State University in EECS department. My current research focus on diffusion process from information theoretical perspective. I also worked on problems in signal processing area such as channel capacity characterization, physical-layer security, and secrecy outage probability. 

Previously, I worked as Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [VNG Corp](https://vng.com.vn/) in Ho Chi Minh City. During this time, I helped lead the Machine Learning team to train computer vision models and architecting production systems for eKYC system. The products, [TrueID solutions](https://trueid.ai/), are being used by multiple banks and financial groups in Vietnam. The tech stack includes: Tensorflow, Pytorch, TensorRT for modelling; Python, C++, Golang for API and backend services; Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Gitlab/Bitbucket for orchestration and deployment.
